    <h1>Our History</h1>
    <p>Smilenation Child Support Initiative was officially established in March 2019 as Smilenation Foundation before the rebranding in August 2022. The foundation was established in a bid to promote quality education for young stars and equip them with resources that would enable them to thrive even in the global space.</p>
    <p>As an NGO (non-governmental organization), weâ€™re comprised of a few team members and we work through the provision of basic items, information sharing, capacity development, self-empowerment, and community development. We seek to proffer solutions to certain problems as they affect Children. All programs and events organized are aligned to one goal working in line with our core values.</p>
